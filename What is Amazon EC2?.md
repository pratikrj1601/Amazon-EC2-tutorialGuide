# Welcome to Amazon EC2 tutorialGuide
Here I have given complete explanation about Amazon EC2 service in very easy and understandabale language. 
you will find theory and practical implementention about how we can create remote instance using amazon EC2.


## What is Amazon EC2 and why we shoud use it?

<ul>
  <li>EC2 stands for Elastic compute cloud
  <li>An AWS EC2 instance is also called as computer, machine, box, PC and server.
  <li>Amazon Elastic compute cloud provides scalable computing capacity in the amazon web services (AWS) cloud. 
  <li>If you use Amazon EC2, you do not require to calculate the cost for hardware and also it will give three major benefits an they are as follows:
  
  <li>vailability: it means your remote machine or instance will run 24 * 7 and you will never face downtime.
  <li> <b>Scalability:</b> you can increase or decrease hardware configurations of EC2 instance at any point of time.
  <li> Pay as you go Pricing:</b> AWS will charge according to the resources you have used.
</ul>

Using EC2 service you can create your virtual instance with Operating system likes Windows, Ubuntu, and various flavours of these operating system. also you can choose from various hardware configurations like how much RAM and HDD(hard disk) you want, how much CPUs you want. you can also add rules for allowing or blocking any type of network traffic to your instance.
