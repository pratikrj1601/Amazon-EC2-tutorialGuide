### Here I have mentioned step by step process of how we can create a windows instance using Amazon EC2 service.

- Stage 1: select AMI (Note: select free tier eligible) </br>
- Stage 2: select instance type (t2.micro) </br>
- Stage 3: select number of instances </br>
- Stage 4: add storage </br>
- Stage 5: tags (leave it as default) </br>
- Stage 6: Security groups </br>
- Stage 7:  Review details and launch and download the key pair. </br>
- Create a new key pair and give suitable name to it. <hr></br>

### But first we will discuss what is Regions and availability zones because it is required before creating instances in EC2<br><br>
